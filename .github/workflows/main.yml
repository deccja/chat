h2. Methodology and System Architecture (Referencing Figure 1)

* The paper introduces a novel training approach for deep physical neural networks (PNNs) termed "model-free forward-forward (MF-FF)" training. This method eschews traditional backpropagation in favor of direct training through dual forward passes, optimizing for contrastive loss.
* The architecture employs layers of arbitrary physical nonlinear systems, where each layer's transformation is defined as \( h^{(l)} = f^{(l)}(W_p^{(l)}x^{(l)}) \), with \( x^{(l)} \), \( W_p^{(l)} \), and \( f^{(l)} \) denoting the physical inputs, physical interconnections, and physical nonlinearity in the \( l \)-th layer, respectively.
* The approach significantly reduces the necessity for precise knowledge of the nonlinear physical layers' properties, diminishing the computational load and power consumption, particularly evident in optical systems.

h2. Experimental Results and Efficiency Metrics (Referencing Figure 2)

* The MF-FF method demonstrated substantial improvements in training speed and efficiency over conventional hardware-aware training methods. This is quantified by a marked reduction in the number of digital computations required and a significant decrease in power consumption during training phases.
* Experimentation across various wave-based PNNs, including acoustic, microwave, and optical systems, revealed robust performance in vowel and image classification tasks. Notably, in optical systems, the method achieved training and test accuracies of 98.93% and 96.73%, respectively, for vowel classification.
* The study highlights the method's superior adaptability, particularly in optics-PNN, where it outperforms traditional physics-aware backpropagation (PA-BP) in environments with dynamic or unpredictable external perturbations. This adaptability is attributed to the MF-FF's unique training process, which circumvents the challenges associated with hardware-realization of backpropagation.
